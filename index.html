    <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>

    <p id = 'main'>Hi I am Alex Ha, a current sophomore attending Northeastern University. 
        I am a data science and biology combined major and I am originally from Long Island, New York. 
        Some of my interests include listening to music, going for runs / walks, and traveling. 
        In Boston, my recommended “go-to” running trail has to be the Charles River Esplanade specifically toward the end of the day to catch the sunset. 
    </p>
