    <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>

    <p id = 'main'>
        Hi I am Alex Ha, a current sophomore attending Northeastern University. 
        I am a data science and biology combined major and I am originally from Long Island, New York. 
        Some of my interests include listening to music, going for runs / walks, and traveling. 
        In Boston, my recommended “go-to” running trail has to be the Charles River Esplanade specifically toward the end of the day to catch the sunset. 
        Below I will paste a picture of the trail I typically run on.
        Some of the most interesting things I have done throughout my time in college so far has been my science research along with my traveling. 
        As for my research, I am currently studying the effects of certain gut bacteria in Parkinson’s induced C. <i>elegans</i> worms by observing 
        fluoresced alpha synuclein protein aggregation, a protein typically found in Parkinson’s patients. 
        As for my traveling, in my first year of college, I attended Northeastern’s London and Oakland campus. During weekends when attending classes at the London campus, 
        I traveled around Europe including Germany, Switzerland, and Greece with my current roommate. Here, we tried new food, explored these country’s cultures, 
        and even attended an NFL football game in Munich Germany.
