    <h1>Website Description</h1>
  
    <p class = "A">
      For this website, I created a GitHub repository and included all pages that are needed as HTML files. 
      Each one of the two pages that I created have titles of their description as well as a button that will navigate you to the other page. 
      This is done by creating a button, adding text to the button, and having a function for the button to navigate to another HTML file. 
      My first HTML file, or page, has the use of storing an introduction paragraph about myself. 
      Here I delve into myself as a student, my hobbies, and some projects that I am currently working on as a sophomore in college. 
      The second HTML file, or page, has the use of storing this paragraph. The paragraph has the use of telling you what my website is as a whole. 
      Additionally, this page will contain a contact section with a link to my LinkedIn. 
      As for the style of my website, the content description page will have a header smaller than the introduction page along with a different font. 
      Also, this paragraph will be encased in a box and the background will be a different color than the introduction page. 
      Thank you for visiting my website!
